### Run As UAC Administrator

[Sandboxie Control](SP_SBControl.md) > [File Menu](FileMenu.md) > Run As UAC Administrator

The _Run As UAC Administrator_ toggle command tells Sandboxie to ask for elevation to Administrative privileges before
starting any programs. This command is only available on Windows Vista when User Account Controls (UAC) is in effect,
and the user account is not already elevated. If this command is available in the menu, then it is typically necessary
to enable it before installing programs into the sandbox, and it is recommended to disable it when that installation is
complete.

There is no window associated with this command. However, while the _Run As UAC Administrator_ is in effect, the command
appears in the [File Menu](FileMenu.md) and [Tray Icon Menu](TrayIconMenu.md) with a checkmark next to it.
