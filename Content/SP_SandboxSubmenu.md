  Sandboxie.

* _Run from Start Menu_: displays the Sandboxie Start menu, similar to the standard Windows Start menu. It can be used
  to start programs and other shortcuts that appear in the start menu and on the desktop. Note that if any programs were
  installed into the sandbox, the Sandboxie Start menu will include the shortcuts created during the installation. The
  files specific to the sandbox are displayed at the top of each folder's content.
